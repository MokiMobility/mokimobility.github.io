Custom Actions allow developers to create their own action references that can be triggered on  the device. MokiManage provides a set of pre-defined actions such as taking screenshots, getting  logs, getting device location, sending messages, and checking compliance. Developers have  the flexibility add their own action references that are specific to the needs of their app and its  users. Custom actions will be included alongside the MokiManage pre-defined actions on the  MokiManage dashboard.

When a custom action is received, the MokiManage SDK will rebroadcast that action with the intent action `MokiManage.CUSTOM_ACTION_INTENT` and with the category equal to the appâ€™s  package name. The message of the action will be stored on the intent as a string extra with the  key `MokiManage.CUSTOM_ACTION_MESSAGE`. For more information on BroadcastReceiver and  Intents, see the [Android documentation](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html).

The APNS notification received from MokiManage will be included in the userInfo of the notification. If you app has multiple custom actions defined, extract the action reference from  userInfo using [notification.userInfo objectForKey:@"command"].

Note: Messaging service is required for custom actions. Make sure that GCM is configured.
