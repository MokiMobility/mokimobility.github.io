Follow Me Support enables support teams to more effectively troubleshoot problems by giving them the ability to follow the screens and taps that a user makes on a mobile device. When  enabled, Follow Me Support captures a screen shot every time the user taps the screen, or  at a regular interval if the user isnâ€™t touching the screen. These screenshots are uploaded to  the MokiManage servers along with the touch coordinates and other metadata. The support  representative will be able to watch in near real-time what the device user is doing. Follow Me  sessions are automatically saved and can be reviewed at any time.

Follow Me Support is activated by a request from the support representative on MokiManage.com. Once the request is sent, the device user will receive a request to begin a  Follow Me session that he or she must accept in order to activate the session.

By implementing the MokiManage SDK in your app, Follow Me Support is available. No additional configuration is required.

> Note: Messaging service is required for Follow Me Support. Make sure that APNS is configured.

> Be aware that sensitive information could be visible in Follow Me sessions, and you may be liable for damages under your privacy policies.
